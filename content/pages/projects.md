## [Women of Startup Nation](https://www.facebook.com/womenofstartupnation)
I help run Women of Startup Nation, a publication which tells the stories of incredible Israeli women in tech. We currently have more than 18,000 followers on Facebook and have interviewed more than 100 women.

We also created a public resource of almost 200 names and contact information for technical female speakers in Israel. [Check it out](http://bit.ly/2LIEaxQ)

## [What the Tech](https://www.instagram.com/_whatthetech/)
I created this Instagram account to try to bridge the gap between software engineers and the rest of the world. I breakdown common tech buzzwords using analogies, try to make code more approachable, debunk common myths about programming, and discuss what it's like to be a software engineer.

## [Olim in Tech](https://www.olimintech.org/)
I'm one of the board members of an organization called Olim in Tech. Founded in 2017, Olim in Tech is a volunteer led community geared towards empowering and connecting olim who work or want to be working in hi-tech. Compared to native born Israelis, who grow up in Israel and spend time in the military, olim often find themselves at a major disadvantage when it comes to finding a job, networking, and generally advancing their career. Olim in Tech aims to bridge the gap by fostering a supportive community of open minded olim through our online presence and by hosting frequent events. Past events include happy hours and speaker events with speakers ranging from members of the community to top VCs and CEOs, who also immigrated to Israel. 

We currently have more than 4,000 members in our Facebook group.

# Past Initiatives:

## [Hack for Olim Hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/pg/OlimInTech/photos/?tab=album&album_id=692319074526029) - August, 2019

<img src="/media/hackathonpic.jpg" alt="Hack for Olim"/>

I wanted to take the concept of "hackathons" from the tech world, and use it to help olim, new immigrants, in Israel. My personal goals in doing this were to: 1) to create a fun event that would be a great networking and community-building opportunity between olim and native Israelis, and 2) to make native Israelis more aware of the challenges olim face in Israel.

I also wanted to use the event as an opportunity to serve as a recruitment platform for the sponsor companies and give exposure to the talented technical olim who are looking for jobs. 

To put on the event, I raised <b>~70,000 NIS (~$21,000)</b> from 7 companies, and 1 grant.

During the event, teams of 4 worked together to create technical solutions to challenges olim face in Israel. 

<b>200+ applicants</b> <br />
<b>125 attendees</b> (50% native Israeli, 50% olim from UK, US, France, Russia, Argentina, Spain, etc.) <br />
<b>25 teams</b> <br />
<b>17 hours</b> <br />
<b>7 company sponsors</b> (Microsoft, Liveperson, Smore, Israel Tech Challenge, Booking.com, WalkMe, Next Insurance) <br />

## [Kfitzah - Coding Bootcamp](https://www.facebook.com/kfitzah/) - February, 2018

A group of us from the US, UK, and France partnered with an organization called ARDC, African Regugee Development Center, to create a basic web development course for a group of 10 adults from Ethiopia, Eritrea, etc. We created the curriculum and course content from scratch, and voluntarily led a series of 8 classes over a 2 month period. I was one of the main teachers teaching the content. 

We found a space to host our course on the weekends, found a donor to donate computers to the students for the duration of the course, and also found volunteer mentors to help the students with their homework during the week in between classes.
